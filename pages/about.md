# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a Robotics Engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions in robotics and AI. I have a master's degree in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering from the University of Tehran, where I also taught a course on Deep Learning. 

I have extensive experience working as a Robotics and Computer Vision Engineer. At AutoRo, I focused on developing an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and led the design and development of a Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) that meets all relevant regulations and standards. My work involved creating state-of-the-art computer vision AI models using ONNX and PyTorch, implementing LDWS and other ADAS components, and using OpenCL and CUDA to efficiently process data. Additionally, I conducted camera calibration, designed real-time camera and AI pipelines on embedded systems, and developed object detection and odometry capabilities. I also implemented control algorithms, such as PID and model predictive control, to steer the vehicle based on data from the vision AI models.

With my deep proficiency in Python, C/C++, PyTorch, TensorRT, OpenCL, CUDA, robotics, and AI models for computer vision and deep learning on embedded systems, I am now actively seeking opportunities in the USA. I am eager to collaborate with industry leaders and pioneers to help shape the future of robotics and AI.
